# Project Note:

| Test | Number of tests | Passed|
|------|-----------------|------|

|Intermediate tests| 15 | 15 |
| Hard tests| 15 | 15 |
|Best fit| 1 | 1 |
|Exec tests| 2 | 2 |
----------------------------
Bonus:
- It can launch my session through tty with startx (When it is not GTK powered or requires posix_memalign or a malloc_align posix compilant)
- If you add posix_memalign and family you can pretty much run every GTK apps
- Supports multithreading
